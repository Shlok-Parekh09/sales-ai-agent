# CustBuds CRM

An AI-native CRM for modern sales teams — built with React, TypeScript, and a Node.js backend. CustBuds combines a full-featured pipeline manager with autonomous AI agents that research prospects, score fit, write personalized outreach sequences, and monitor deal health in real time.

## Features

### CRM Core

**Contacts** — Create, import, search, sort, and paginate contacts. Double-click any cell to inline-edit fields. Ctrl+click a contact name to open a full details modal. Export the table as CSV at any time.

**Companies** — Full company table with inline editing. Create a company and immediately trigger the Prospecting Agent to generate a scored research brief and email sequence. Select any saved company and run prospecting on demand.

**Deals Pipeline** — Two-section pipeline view (Active Deals and Closed Won) with inline stage, priority, and owner editing. Tracks deal value, cycle length, and expected close date. Auto-calculates total pipeline value, average cycle, and next close date per section.

**Meetings & Calls** — Activity log tables for meetings and calls with editable fields (company, contact, owner, date, status, next steps). All activity data feeds directly into the Deal Intelligence Agent.

### AI Agents

**Prospecting Agent** (`/api/agent/prospect`) — Given a company name and optional metadata, the agent researches the target across public signals, scores product–market fit (0–100), identifies the key buying contact, writes two personalized outreach emails, generates a multi-step engagement sequence, and recommends next best actions. Results are stored locally and visible in the Prospecting Agent view.

**Deal Intelligence Agent** (`/api/agent/deal-intelligence`) — Continuously scores every active deal's health based on CRM coverage gaps, engagement recency, late-stage thread count, competitor mentions in activity notes, and timeline risk. For each at-risk deal it generates a recovery play with a headline, recommended action, and specific talking points. Alerts surface the highest-signal risks in real time.

### Email Sequences

Connect Gmail, Outlook, or a generic mailto provider from the Settings modal. Start Sequence opens a pre-filled compose window with the selected email draft and your saved signature. Schedule stores the sequence locally and shows a scheduled timestamp.

### Data Management

- CSV import with fuzzy header matching (handles variations like "Deal Value" / "Amount" / "Revenue")
- CSV export for contacts, companies, and deals
- All data is persisted to `localStorage` — no database required to run locally
- Multi-select with bulk delete across all tables

## Database (Included for Testing)

A sample database used for testing and validation is included with this repository. It provides pre-populated CRM data (contacts, companies, deals, and activities) to help you quickly explore features and verify system behavior without needing to create data from scratch.

- The dataset is stored locally and is compatible with the app’s `localStorage`-based persistence.
- It can be used to simulate real-world CRM workflows, including pipeline tracking and AI agent execution.
- You can modify, extend, or replace this dataset as needed for custom testing scenarios.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com) for the Prospecting Agent
- A [Tavily API key](https://tavily.com) for source-backed company research
- A [Mistral API key](https://console.mistral.ai) for the Deal Intelligence Agent

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shlok-Parekh09/AI_based_CRM.git
cd AI_based_CRM
```

### 2. Set up environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_tavily_key_here
MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_mistral_key_here
PORT=5000
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
npm run install:all
```

### 4. Start backend and frontend together

```bash
npm run dev
```

The backend will run at `http://localhost:5000`.
The frontend will open at `http://localhost:3000`.

You can still start each app separately if needed:

Backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage Tips

- **Create + Prospect** — When creating a new company, use the "Create + Prospect" button to simultaneously add the company to the CRM and trigger the AI agent. A loading banner appears while the agent works.
- **Prospect selected** — In the Companies table, select a single company row and click "Prospect selected" to run the agent against an existing record.
- **Prospect All** — From the Prospecting Agent view, click "Prospect All" to batch-research every saved company in sequence.
- **Inline editing** — Double-click any text cell in any table to edit it in place. Press Enter to commit or Escape to cancel.
- **Deal health scoring** — The health score is recalculated every 15 seconds and on window focus, so it always reflects the latest CRM activity.
